### TOOLS 
- Laravel 10.
- Laravel Pint (formatter).
- Phpstan/Larastan (static analyzer), MAX Level.
- PhpUnit (testing).
- Barry Laravel IdeHelper (it helps to have the models up to date with the fields and not using magic attributes and needed for Phpstan).

### COMMENTS AND EXPLANATIONS
- I think ```is_public``` is not used in the task description.
- Ideally, 'users' table should be used for _users_ and another table for _admins_
- Obviously, this is an example of a CRUD, but approaches like Hexagonal Architecture pays off in the long run.
- In the request, I like to work with type hints (a 'problem' with $request->thingy is that you don't know what's 'thingy').
I have used RequestServiceProvider for the sake of an example in how to extend the Framework in a clean way.
- Why not using ```Laravel Resources```? Following SRP and after my experience, every endpoint MUST have a
specific Request and a specific Response. Changes in the long run will be easier to handle.

### DOCS
- Inside ```docs``` folder you can find the ```changelog``` and the openapi.yaml
initial doc. Inside each endpoint folder you have the specifications (with ChatGPT or similar, you can 
generate based on the form request and response the document really fast).

- I use redocly for the OpenAPI documentation.
```shell
yarn install
yarn docs:build
yarn docs:serve
```
